  - This is the template for the homepage.
    https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/files/index-liquid

  - The use of sections allows us configure them in the Shopify Theme Editor.

  - Sections can be found in \src\sections.

  - It usually just has the single line:

      {{ content_for_index }}

    which is used to support dynamic sections.

  - This piece of magic is what enables the homepage to display sections that
    are dynamically configured in the Shopify Admin UI.  For more info:

      https://shopify.dev/tutorials/develop-theme-use-sections

  - {{ content_for_index }} is a node in \boni\src\config\settings_data.json
    that references sections to include.  For example:

      {
        "current": "Default",
        "presets": {
          "Default": {
            "sections": { ... },
            "content_for_index": [
              "collection-list",
              "featured-collection",
              "featured-product"
            ]
          }
        }
      }

  - Those sections are names of liquid files in \boni\src\sections\*.liquid
    For example:

      \boni\src\sections\collection-list.liquid
      \boni\src\sections\featured-collection.liquid
      \boni\src\sections\featured-product.liquid

  - Each of those section files contains a {-% schema %-} section at the bottom
    of the file that includes any setting a user can configure via the
    Shopify Theme Editor.  The part of a section that is rendered in the
    homepage corresponds to the "presets" in the {-% schema %-}.  Only these
    are pulled into the homepage.  These are called "dynamic sections".

  - A "static section" is one that is defined in a section, not in the presets,
    and only shows in the page where that section is rendered via:

      {% section "foobar" %}

  - Other snippets/sections/content can be added to the homepage by adding
    them to this page: above, below, or replacing the {{ content_for_index }}.

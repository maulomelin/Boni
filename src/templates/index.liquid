  - This is the template for the homepage. It usually just has the single line:

      {{ content_for_index }}

  - This piece of magic is what enables the homepage to display sections that
    are dynamically configured in the Shopify Admin UI.  For more info:

      https://shopify.dev/tutorials/develop-theme-use-sections

  - {{ content_for_index }} is a node in \boni\src\config\settings_data.json
    that references sections to include.  For example:

      {
        "current": "Default",
        "presets": {
          "Default": {
            "sections": { ... },
            "content_for_index": [
              "collection-list",
              "featured-collection",
              "featured-product"
            ]
          }
        }
      }

  - Those sections are names of liquid files in \boni\src\sections\*.liquid
    For example:

      \boni\src\sections\collection-list.liquid
      \boni\src\sections\featured-collection.liquid
      \boni\src\sections\featured-product.liquid

  - Each of those section files contains a {% schema %} section at the bottom
    of the file that includes any setting a user can configure via the
    Shopify Admin UI.  The snippet code makes reference to these settings to
    determine what to do.  For example:

      {% if section.settings.show_share_buttons %}
        <div data-action="do" data-what="something" />
      {% endif %}

  - To render static content, simply add it to this page.  Above, below, or
    replacing the {{ content_for_index }} entry.

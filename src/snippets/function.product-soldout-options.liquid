SNIPPET:
  function.product-soldout-options.liquid

USAGE:
  {%- include "function.product-soldout-options", product: product -%}
  {{ product_soldout_options }}

PARAMETERS:
  {product object} product[ required ] // The product object to analyze.

OUTPUT:
  - A string containing the product's variant's option combinations where
      variant.inventory_quantity == 0 AND variant.inventory_policy == "deny"
  - The options and combinations are delimited.
  - A sample output string:
      ["White","s0"]##["Pearl","s2"]##["Pearl","s3"]##["Cinnamon","s1"]##["Chedron","s1"]##["Chedron","s3"]##["Black","s2"]##["Gray","s0"]##["Indigo","s0"]##["Indigo","s1"]##["Indigo","s2"]

DESCRIPTION:
  - This function finds all variants that are out of stock and generates a
    string containing all option combinations for those variants.
  - We walk through all product variants looking for ones with no inventory.
    and where the inventory policy is set to "deny".
      - If a variant has no inventory, concatenate that variant's options and
        add them an aggregated "sold out" list.
      - If a variant has inventory, skip it.
  - The items in the "sold out" list are those whose option combinations
    are out of stock.

  - Note that this function is designed for only up to two options.  For more
    options, the "sold out" list needs to contain combination of options
    such as "white:s0" and not just "s0".

TODOs:
  - Update the snippet to work when 3 options are used, using the "{{ variant.options | json }}" filter.
  - Verify that the setup works with compound-word options (e.g. "jewel blue").
